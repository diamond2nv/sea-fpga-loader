# sea-fpga-loader
ESP-IDF version of FPGA config loader for Spartan Edge Accelerator Board

This is sample code on how to correctly parse a 7 Series bitstream and send it
from the ESP32 down to the Spartan 7 Accelerator on the Seeed Studio
Spartan Edge Accelerator Board (see https://www.seeedstudio.com/Spartan-Edge-Accelerator-Board-p-4261.html).

I had copied this over from a working version but have yet to test it in isolation. Hence, it should just serve
as an example of how to do this and nothing more.
